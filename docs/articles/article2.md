## Twitter

This month I have been focusing on twitter. The goal for twitter was to build a following so that I would be able to have an audience to share Anon Shop with. It does not matter how good your product is if no one knows about it. I was able to gain about 1,000 followers in two months, so I would say it was a success. My tweets even got me some [interviews](https://www.youtube.com/live/esxj_FI0nPY?feature=share). You can track my tweet [success](https://typefully.com/AnonShopApp/stats)
 here. How much money and sales did we make from these tweets?  

## Cash Money?

My twitter growth was effective at driving people to my site whenever I tweet about it. Every time I tweet about my service, I get a large spike in visits to my landing page.

This issue is that I am not able to convert these visits into sales. Marketing != Sales. This past month has been an ok month, but there was not a tight correlation between follows and sales. We did around ~4,000 (very rough estimate) in sales this past month. That is topline revenue. So we made profit, but not a ton. We have seen growth though, and it's awesome to put something out and have the community support it. I look forward to future growth. 

## Why are you being so open?

I have spent years studying privacy projects and how they make money. I hate how most
privacy companies don't tell you anything about the business. So I hope that my little experiment at Anon Shop can inspire other people to start their own businesses. The world needs more privacy-focused businesses.

## Whats Next

I am going to be taking a break from tweeting every day to work on expanding Anon Shop. I need to do some dev work and add the ability for people to place orders in Monero and receive a discount. I hope to have this feature launched by next week so stay tuned if that is something that you want to use. Here is the [github](https://github.com/DecentralizeJustice/anonymousLocker/tree/btcpayEarner) if you want to track its development. 

## Thanks
I hope you found this quick write-up entertaining. I would like to thank Doug and Sunita from Monerotopia for being awesome and letting me do the dev segment on their show. I also want to thank [Vanessa](https://twitter.com/technologypoet) for the awesome interview. Most importantly I want to thank my awesome customers. Yall trusted a random person on the internet with your Monero and thank you so much for that leap of faith. I will continue to build a better service for the world to enjoy.
