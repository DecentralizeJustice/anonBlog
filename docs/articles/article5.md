# Sorry for the Wait

> Update After Months

<!-- more -->

## Where Have I been?
Sorry, I have not been writing in the past couple of months. I built and launched an anonymous phone service. This service went pretty well. I was able to really work on making websites that not only function well but look good also.

Building and launching this felt like the culmination of years of work. I learned a ton about how phones work and people enjoy the service. You can see the site [HERE](https://phantomphone.app//). I have a free phone up to demo, so shoot some funny messages or test it if you want.

## Whats Next?

A while ago I rebranded to Anon Industries so that I could work under different privacy projects under one umbrella. Building on that idea I am working on Anon Hub. Anon Hub is a home server built on open-source software for people who want to use and stay up-to-date on privacy tech. So think Umbrel with an e-ink screen to give interesting info daily. I have all the parts for this working and I simply need to put it in a pretty 3D-printed case. I tweet about this project a couple of times a week, but if you have any questions please ask me. I love it when people ask me things and it lets me know someone actually reads my blog.....


## Thanks

I have the best customers in the world. A lot of people talk about privacy on the internet and larp as privacy warriors, but there are so few people who actually put their money where their mouth is and support privacy. All of my customers support me and my privacy products. All of the support feels amazing and whenever I have a rough day the support keeps me going. Thanks again for all the support ðŸ˜Ž
